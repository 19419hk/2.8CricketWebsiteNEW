      <p class="w3-text-grey">Cricket is basically a simple sport. Each team consisting of 11 players takes its turn to bat (scoring runs) and bowl (getting the opposition batsmen out). The team with the most runs at the end wins. Unless the game is drawn, of course . . . Like any sport thatâ€™s been around for a while, cricket has its own laws, legend and language. You will learn more about those things over the course of your stay on this site.</p>

      <h1>Fun Facts about Cricket</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Although cricket is one of the most popular sports in the world, its presence in some countries is notoriously non-existant. But why not take you a few centures back to where it all began?</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey"><li>It is said that cricket originated in England. Since they used to raise sheep, the grass was so short that it was possible to roll a lump of wool on it which they used as a ball.</li>
      <li>The first recorded game was played in 1646, and later fines were handed out for those who missed the church to play.</li><li>The longest cricket match took place in 1939 between England and South Africa, after 14 days it ended with a tie.</li>
      <li>A cricket game was once stopped because a pig ran across the field. It is even considered legal to suspend the game if an animal entered the field.</li>
