      <h1>The Roles in each Cricket Team</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">There are four main roles in a Cricket Team.</h5> They are <p>Batsmen</p><p>Bowlers</p><p>All-Rounders</p><p>Wicket-Keepers</p>

      <p class="w3-text-black">Bowlers are the players in the team who try to bowl the other team out while also trying their best to restrict the amount of runs the other team scores. Batsmen do the exact opposite. Batsmen try to score as many runs as possible without getting out to the bowlers. All-Rounders are generally players who are fluent in both batting and bowling while not being specialists at either. The Wicket-Keeper is the player on the fielding side who stands behind the wicket or stumps being watchful of the batsman and be ready to take a catch, stump the batsman out and run out a batsman when occasion . The wicket-keeper is the only member of the fielding side permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards. Out of the 11 players on any team, a captain must be appointed. The captain of a cricket team, often referred to as the skipper, is the appointed leader, having several additional roles and responsibilities over and above those of the other players. A captain's knowledge of the complexities of cricket strategy and tactics, and shrewdness in the field, may contribute significantly to the team's success.</p>

      <h1>The Twenty20 Format</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The Twenty20 Format of Cricket is the shortest, and perhaps most exciting form of cricket that exists to date. Twenty20 cricket consists of two innings of twenty overs each, for a game totalling 40 overs. T20 games are usually played in the evening, which gives them the extra atmosphere and intensity.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-black">Because of the reduced overs in this format, batters are expected to score faster and take lots of risks, which leads to a higher chance of wickets. It is this hit or miss mentality which makes the T20 format such an exciting one. A typical Twenty20 game is completed in about three hours, with each innings lasting around 90 minutes and an official 10 minute break between the innings. This is much shorter than previously-existing forms of the game, and is closer to the timespan of other popular team sports. It was introduced to create a fast-paced form of the game which would be attractive to spectators at the ground and viewers on television. The game has succeeded in spreading around the cricket world. On most international tours there is at least one Twenty20 match and all Test-playing nations have a domestic cup competition. The inaugural ICC World Twenty20 was played in South Africa in 2007.</p>

      <h1>The One Day Format</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">One Day games of cricket are called One Dayers because well, you guessed it, they usually go for a long period of time which is usually around eight hours. It is seen as the main and most important form of cricket to some, as it tests the key attributes needed to be a great cricketer. One Day games usually have two innings of fifty overs per side.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-black">Despite its name, important one-day matches, international and domestic, often have two days set aside, the second day being a "reserve" day to allow more chance of the game being completed if a result is not possible on the first day (for instance if play is prevented or interrupted by rain). One-day cricket is popular with spectators as it can encourage aggressive, risky, entertaining batting, often results in cliffhanger endings, and ensures that a spectator can watch an entire match without committing to five days of continuous attendance (Test matches).</p>

      <h1>The Test Format</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Test cricket is the form of the sport of cricket with the longest match duration, and is considered the game's highest standard. Test matches are played between national representative teams that have been granted ‘Test status’, as determined and conferred by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The term Test stems from the fact that the long, gruelling matches are mentally and physically testing. Unlike previous formats, a Test match consists of four innings (two for each team) which go until the bowling team bowls the batting team out, or the batting team decides to retire and bowl. Tests typically last up to 5 days, or less if a team has won before then.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-black">The first officially recognised Test match took place between 15 and 19 March 1877 and was played between England and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), where Australia won by 45 runs. A Test match to celebrate 100 years of Test cricket was held in Melbourne between 12 and 17 March 1977, in which Australia beat England by 45 runs—the same margin as that first Test. In October 2012, the ICC recast the playing conditions for Test matches, permitting day/night Test matches. The first day/night game took place between Australia and New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide, on 27 November – 1 December 2015. Women's Test cricket is played over four days, with slight differences in format from men's Tests.</p>
