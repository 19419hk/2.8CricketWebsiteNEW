      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The England Cricket team is currently in First place in the official ICC One Day International Rankings. They have a rating of 125, only slightly ahead of 2nd place. They won the most recent edition of the ICC Cricket World Cup, beating New Zealand in the final.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">England's kit is manufactured by New Balance, who replaced previous manufacturer Adidas in April 2017. When playing Test cricket, England's cricket whites feature the three lions badge on the left of the shirt and the name and logo of the sponsor NatWest on the right. English fielders may wear a navy blue cap or white sun hat with the ECB (England Cricket Board) logo in the middle. Helmets are also coloured navy blue. Before 1997 the uniform sported the TCCB (Test and County Cricket Board) lion and stumps logo on the uniforms, while the helmets, jumpers and hats had the three lions emblem. In limited overs cricket, England's ODI and Twenty20 shirts feature the NatWest logo across the centre, with the three lions badge on the left of the shirt and the New Balance logo on the right. In ODIs, the kit comprises a blue shirt with navy trousers, whilst the Twenty20 kit comprises a flame red shirt and navy trousers. In ICC limited-overs tournaments, a modified kit design is used with sponsor's logo moving to the sleeve and 'ENGLAND' printed across the front. Over the years, England's ODI kit has cycled between various shades of blue (such as a pale blue used until the mid-1990s, when it was replaced in favour of a bright blue) with the occasional all-red kit.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The Indian Cricket Team sit at 2nd place on the rankings, a mere 3 rating points off England, with India on 122 points. India most recently won the Cricket World Cup in 2011, after a thrilling final beating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Many Indians hold cricket very close to their hearts and losses are not received well by the Indian population. In some cases, particularly after losses to Pakistan or after a long string of weak performances, there have been reports of player effigies being burnt in the streets and vandalism of player homes. In many cases, players have come under intense attention from the media for negative reasons, this has been considered as one of the reasons for Sourav Ganguly being left out of the Indian team. At times, when a match is surrounded by controversy, it has resulted in a debacle. For example, when India slid to defeat against Australia at Brabourne Stadium in 1969, fans began throwing stones and bottles onto the field as well as setting fire to the stands, before laying siege to the Australian dressing rooms. During the same tour, a stampede occurred at Eden Gardens when tickets were oversold and India fell to another loss; the Australian team bus was later stoned with bricks. This gives you a sense of just how big cricket is in India, and how passionate the followers are.</p>

      <h1>New Zealand</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">New Zealand come into the rankings at 3rd place with 112 rating points. After a highly successful World Cup campaign which saw them drop to 2nd in the finals, their ranking has been boosted a lot. Despite being a small nation, New Zealand has regularly overachieved in the sport.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">The New Zealand cricket team became known as the Black Caps in January 1998, after its sponsor at the time, Clear Communications, held a competition to choose a name for the team. This is one of many national team nicknames related to the All Blacks. In limited overs cricket, New Zealand's ODI and Twenty20 shirts feature the ANZ logo across the centre, with the silver fern badge on the left of the shirt, Canterbury logo on the right sleeve and the Ford logo on the right. In ODIs, the kit comprises a black shirt with blue accents and black trousers, whilst the Twenty20 kit comprises a beige shirt with black accents and black trousers. In ICC limited-overs tournaments, a modified kit design is used with sponsor's logos moving to the sleeve and 'NEW ZEALAND' printed across the front. In ODI, New Zealand wore Beige and brown between 1980 World Series Cricket and 1988 World Series Cricket. The 1983–1984 version was made popular by the Black Caps supporter group Beige Brigade, who sells the version of this uniform to the general public together with a "moral contract" which explains the expectations that come with being a Beige Brigadier. and was also worn in the inaugural Twenty20 international between New Zealand and Australia. Between 1991 and 1997 grey or silver (with some splashes of black or white) was worn instead. Until 2000, the ODI uniform was teal with black accents.</p>

      <h1>Australia</h1>

They are just one point behind New Zealand and are arguably underachieving with the squad they have. Australia has been a dominant force since the inception of cricket, and this ranking does them little justice, as they can beat any team comfortably on their day.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">The Australian men's national cricket team represents Australia in international cricket. As one of the oldest teams in Test cricket history, playing in the first ever Test match in 1877, the team also plays One-Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) cricket, participating in both the first ODI, against England in the 1970–71 season and the first T20I, against New Zealand in the 2004–05 season, winning both games. The team draws its players from teams playing in the Australian domestic competitions – the Sheffield Shield, the Australian domestic limited-overs cricket tournament and the Big Bash League. On 12 January 2019, Australia won the first ODI against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground by 34 runs, to record their 1,000th win in international cricket.</p>

      <h1>South Africa</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The South African Cricket Team currently resides at Fifth Place on the ICC Rankings for ODI's. Despite being a powerhouse on the world stage, South Africa has failed to make a single World Cup Final appearance in its history.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">The South African national cricket team also known as Proteas (after South Africa's national flower, Protea cynaroides, commonly known as the ‘king protea’), is administered by Cricket South Africa. South Africa is a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One-Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status. South Africa has a record of failing to win major tournaments and is much-maligned because of this. The 1992 Cricket World Cup, for example, featured a rain-affected semi-final played before the introduction of the Duckworth-Lewis rain rule. South Africa needed 22 runs from 13 balls when rain intervened. After the delay they were left in the situation of requiring 22 runs from one ball to progress. In 1996 they were eliminated in the quarter-finals despite being one of the fancied teams and having qualified first in their group.In 1999 South Africa lost in the semi-final to eventual champions Australia. The match ended in a tie both South Africa and Australia managing 213 but Australia advanced to the Final as Australia finished higher than South Africa in the group.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is responsible for all first class and Test cricket played in Pakistan and by the Pakistan cricket team. It was admitted to the International Cricket Council in July 1953. The corporation has been run by former cricketers, professional administrators and trustees, who are often respected businessmen. The Board governs a network of teams sponsored by corporations and banks, city associations and clubs including advertising, broadcasting rights and internet partners. In the past, Pakistan has suffered a lot from terrorism which prevented foreign teams from visiting Pakistan primarily due to the 2009 attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team. As a result, their home matches have been mostly held in the United Arab Emirates since then. However, due to a decrease in terrorism in Pakistan over the past few years, as well as an increase in security, some teams have toured Pakistan since 2015 and the situation appears to be getting better. These teams include Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, West Indies, and an ICC World XI.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Bangladesh holds the record for most consecutive losses in Tests (21, between 2000 and 2002) and ODIs (23, between 2001 and 2004). After gaining Full Member status with the ICC, Bangladesh had to wait until 2004 for its first ODI win since the 1999 World Cup. The team on the losing side on that occasion was Zimbabwe, who also participated in Bangladesh's maiden Test victory in 2005; by securing a draw in the second match, Bangladesh won their first Test series. In 2009 Bangladesh toured the West Indies for two Tests and by winning both secured their first overseas Test series victory. The team has been more successful in ODIs. Bangladesh is currently ranked ninth in Tests, seventh in ODIs and tenth in T20Is by the ICC.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Sri Lanka's national cricket team achieved considerable success beginning in the 1990s, rising from underdog status to winning the Cricket World Cup in 1996. Since then, the team has continued to be a force in international cricket. The Sri Lankan cricket team reached the finals of the 2007 and 2011 Cricket World Cups consecutively. They ended up being runners up on both occasions. Sri Lanka won the Cricket World Cup in 1996, the ICC Champions Trophy in 2002 (co-champions with India), and the ICC T20 World Cup in 2014. They have been consecutive runners up in the 2007 and 2011 Cricket World Cups, and have been runners up in the ICC T20 World Cup in 2009 and 2012. The Sri Lankan cricket team currently holds several world records, including the world record for the highest team total in Test cricket.</p>

The players on this composite team are selected from a chain of fifteen Caribbean territories, which are parts of several different countries and dependencies. As of 24 June 2018, the West Indies cricket team is ranked ninth in the world in Tests, ninth in One-Day Internationals (ODIs) and seventh in Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) in the official International Cricket Council (ICC) rankings.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">From the mid-late 1970s to the early 1990s, the West Indies team was the strongest in the world in both Test and One Day International cricket. The West Indies have won the ICC Cricket World Cup twice (1975 and 1979), the ICC World Twenty20 twice (2012 and 2016), the ICC Champions Trophy once (2004), the ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup once (2016), and have also finished as runners-up in the Cricket World Cup (1983), the Under 19 Cricket World Cup (2004), and the ICC Champions Trophy (2006). The West Indies appeared in three consecutive World Cup finals (1975, 1979 and 1983), and were the first team to win back-to-back World Cups (1975 and 1979). The West Indies has hosted the 2007 Cricket World Cup and the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. In June 2019, during the 2019 Cricket World Cup, the West Indies played their 800th ODI match.</p>

Afghanistan have only recently begun their foray into the top tier of the cricket scene, only playing their first ODI Cricket World cup in 2015. Out of their 15 ODI World cup games played, they have only a sole win, coming in 2015 against Scotland.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey"> After nearly a decade of playing top class international cricket, on 22 June 2017, in an ICC meeting in London, full ICC Membership (and therefore Test status) was granted to Afghanistan (concurrently with Ireland), taking the number of Test cricket playing nations to twelve. They are also the first country to ever achieve full member status after holding Affiliate Membership of the ICC from 2001 until 2013 and were the only Affiliate member country to ever compete in a major ICC international cricket tournament. They hold the world record for the highest ever T20 score with their 278-3 against Ireland at Dehradun on 23 February 2019. In March 2019 against Ireland, Afghanistan achieved their first Test match victory in their only second Test match, becoming only the third team after England and Pakistan to do so. As you can see, it has been a dramatic rise in stocks for the country of Afghanistan when it comes to the world cricketing stage.</p>
