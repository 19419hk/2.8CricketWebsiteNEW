      <h1>What exactly are the laws of cricket?</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">In cricket, the rules of the game are specified in a code called The Laws of Cricket (hereinafter called "the Laws") which has a global remit. There are 42 Laws (always written with a capital "L"). The earliest known version of the code was drafted in 1744 and, since 1788, it has been owned and maintained by its custodian, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">There are 42 Laws of the game which I will not go into because that would be super boring and long and trust me, you don't want that. Instead I'll talk about the oral tradition of cricket, and summarize the Laws down below. The origin of cricket is uncertain and it was first definitely recorded at Guildford in the 16th century. It is believed to have been a boys' game at that time but, from early in the 17th century, it was increasingly played by adults. Rules as such existed and, in early times, would have been agreed orally and subject to local variations. Cricket in the late 17th century became a betting game attracting high stakes and there were instances of teams being sued for non-payment of wagers they had lost.</p>

      <h1>A Summary of the Laws</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Here is a brief overview of a few of the simple laws, and down below will be a link to where you can read all of them. <li>Law 1 - A team consists of eleven players, including a captain.</li><li>Law 4 - A cricket ball is between 8.81 and 9 inches in circumference, and weighs between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces. </li><li>Law 17 - An over consists of six balls bowled, excluding wides and no-balls. Consecutive overs are delivered from opposite ends of the pitch. A bowler may not bowl two consecutive overs.</li><li>Law 18 - Runs are scored when the two batsmen run to each other's end of the pitch. Several runs can be scored from one ball.</li><li>Law 19 - A boundary is marked around the edge of the field of play. If the ball is hit into or past this boundary, four runs are scored, or six runs if the ball doesn't hit the ground before crossing the boundary.</li><li>Law 31 - If the fielders believe a batsman is out, they may ask the umpire "How's That?" before the next ball is bowled. The umpire then decides whether the batsman is out. Strictly speaking, the fielding side must appeal for all dismissals, including obvious ones such as bowled. However, a batsman who is obviously out will normally leave the pitch without waiting for an appeal or a decision from the umpire.</li><li>Law 42 - The umpires shall penalise unacceptable conduct based on the severity of the actions. Serious misconduct can see a player sent from field; lesser offences, a warning and penalty runs.</li></h5>
